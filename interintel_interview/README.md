This is a simple interview project that focuses on data insertion into an SQL database
this project is written using he following technologies
- Django(python) used to perform back end logic
- Jinja, html, css used to provide a user interface
- sqlite to store data(I opted for this because the project was not complex and this would work perfectly)
